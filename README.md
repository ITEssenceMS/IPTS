# IPTS

IPTS (**the Interplanetary Travel Syndicate**) is a galactic empire newly launched transportation network that shuttles people from world to world within our galaxy. For now it includes 3 different applications that allow you to travel, monitor, and learn more about new planets. 
The three apps are:

1. **Travel:** With this app, you can book your travel to different planets within the empire. You can choose from a variety of transportation options, including spaceships and shuttles.
2. **Discover:** This app helps you to explore new planets and discover new cultures, species, and places. You can read articles and watch videos about the history and geography of each planet.
3. **Rail:** The Rail app is designed to check and monitor current lines, routes, and times for all the different commuter lines.
